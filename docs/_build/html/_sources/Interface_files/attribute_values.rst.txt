.. _attr_values:

Attribute values
----------------

The following section gives an overview of the different characteristics that the user can give to a custom attribute.
The syntax is always the same, because a list is passed, which has an identifier at the first position, which determines
the type. The following elements define the concrete characteristic or distribution depending on the type.

* :ref:`Binary <binary>`
* :ref:`Normal <normal>`
* :ref:`Fix <fix>`

....

.. _binary:

Binary
******

To signal that an attribute should be binary distributed the identifier "b" must be used as the first argument in the
passed list. The second parameter specifies as a float the probability that the attribute takes the value 1.

.. code-block:: JSON

   "roasted": ["b",0.03]
   "cracked": ["b",0.012]

.. _normal:

Normal
******

To signal that an attribute should be normal distributed the identifier "n" must be used as the first argument in the
passed list. The second parameter determines the mean value and the third the standard deviation. These additional
parameters can be integers or floats, where the standard deviation must be greater than or equal to zero.

.. code-block:: JSON

   "surface_quality": ["n",1,0.05]
   "weight": ["n",130.5,1]

.. _fix:

Fix
***

To signal that an attribute should be a fix value the identifier "f" must be used as the first argument in the passed
list. The second parameter determines value the this attribute should have. Accepted types are integers and floats.

.. code-block:: JSON

   "prob_of_failure": ["f",0.01]
