Example 01: Setup process
-------------------------

In this example, a textual description of a sample process is converted into a formal structure, which can be passed to
the program as an input file. In addition, this data is then inspected and visualized.

* :ref:`Create input files <create>`
* :ref:`Inspect the data <inspect>`
* :ref:`Visualize the data <visualize>`

.. note::
   The following example does not claim to represent a real existing process, but aims to show as many facets as
   possible.

.. _create:

Create input files
******************



.. _inspect:

Inspect the data

.. _visualize:
