``Environment``
---------------

The Environment class is the central class of the program, because all other functionalities are called and synchronized
via this class. When creating an environment instance, the corresponding data that is to be represented by this instance
must be passed directly. This process data passed during initialization is stored in an internal format and
automatically provided to the corresponding method when various functions are called.
