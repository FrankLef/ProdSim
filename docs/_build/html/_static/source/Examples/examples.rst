Examples
========

The aim of this section is to illustrate the entire process of how this program should be used. The examples are not
constructed in such a way, in order to represent as real circumstances as possible, but in order to refer as versatile
as possible to all special features.
There will be four examples that chronologically map the use of the program.

* :ref:`Create input file <example_1>`
* :ref:`Inspect and visualize input data <example_2>`
* :ref:`Start simulation and create output data <example_3>`
* :ref:`Plot output data <example_4>`
