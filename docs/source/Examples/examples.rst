Examples
========

In this chapter, the concrete use of the simulation program is presented through the use of examples. The aim of these
examples is not to represent realistic contexts. Instead, they represent as many aspects as possible and are
chronologically oriented to the later workflow. In addition, the examples are independent of each other in order to look
up individual functionalities selectively. The following table serves as a guide:
